SHORT ANSWERS
    [X] Comment below what the difference between TestNG and the main method is
        // Main Method:
            Used to run the main method defined in the Main Java Class and view the Output results.
            For example, this main method uses print lines to demonstrate how the methods are functioning and their output.
            A Java Class cannot be executed without a Main Method.
        // TestNG:
            TestNG is a testing framework that is used to verify and validate methods based on expected results.
            Rather than printing the output for manual verification, it uses asserts with expected values and will pass/fail the test depending on the result.
